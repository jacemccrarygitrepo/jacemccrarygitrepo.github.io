                + Robot and a Plot of Land <br>
                    Pretty much, the Robot will be able to build and maintain a House, Car, Farm, create Energy and Water, Clean, <br>
                    Cook, and anything else you can think of. This turns a $10 million dollar house, into maybe $200,000!
                <br>
                <br>
                Imagine this: <br>
                You get a 1 acre plot of land right? And just 1 Robot. <br>
                You then either build or simply upload the schematics for how you want everything built, and it builds everything <br>
                in just a few months! <br>
                Your robot will even help you customize your car, house, dishes you want to farm and cook, and everything else. <br>
                It can even build computers and all kinds of tech for you! <br>
                <br>
                You will never have to work again. You'll farm solor energy, create H20 and O2 using simple science, <br>
                and can sell your food, water, air, energy, and everything else to the government or your local community <br>
                and help them build their farms! <br>
                Eventually, everyone will be fully self sustainable and never have to work again. We will just work for fun! <br>
                <br>
                For Perspective:
                You will never have to pay for anything ever again. Everything will come from self-sustainability. <br>
                You won't have to pay for anything, because everything will be free, and more!<br>
                Let's say you have a multi-layered underground farm, a few sets of chicken, cattle, a small pond for fish, <br>
                and all of your O2 and H20 Equipment. You will produce so much, so efficiently, that you will <br>
                sell your surplus to your neighbors and the local government for cash!<br>
                <br>
                + Now: <br>
                    This is where we are getting into the 'I Don't Know' Part. <br>
                <br>
                    Our Body's run off of vibrations, and these vibrations can be slowed to age, or increased to slow aging. <br>
                    I haven't figured out completely yet, but it is more than possible. <br>
                    The point is to be able to live forever, and stop aging completely with something as simple as just a vibration and <br>
                    non-crazy living. It is very simple once you think of it, and all the science leads there, so not only will everyone be <br>
                    fully self-sufficient, we will be able to live forever. All from the comfort of your own home.<br>
                <br>
                    Even then, your robot will be able to build you a simple external BCI (brain computer interface). <br>
                    And you will never sin again. You will be able to choose your own thoughts, remove bad memories, and have <br>
                    unlimited ways of anything! <br>
                    Very big responsibility I know, but imagine nothing being wrong or affecting you again! Definitely worth the responsibility in my opinion. <br>
                    No one will have an excuse for anything bad happening ever again. It is all taken care of with a robot. Just a robot! <br>
                <br>
                Yea!
